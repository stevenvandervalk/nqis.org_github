# Ruby on Rails Development Services

## Ruby on Rails Development
At our core, we're Ruby on Rails developers. We specilize in building custom web applications using agile methodologies that allow us to create error-free code, on time and on budget. We don't take a 'put your head down and code approach.' Rather, we keep the communication going throughout the process, with you taking an active role in the development of your app. This allows us to adjust to changes quickly as we make new discoveries along the way.

## Ruby on Rails Consulting
Our rails consulting service is perfect for the startup or business that needs help creating a requirements document, wants to integrate agile methodologies into their team, or just needs an action plan for improving communication, making teams more independent and self-sufficient, honing processes for greatest efficiency. 

## Rails Updates
If your web app was developed a few years ago, chances are you're running on an older version of Rails. When you update, it may help your app's performance, but it may also break it. That's why you bring us in to professionally transition you to the latest rails update.

## Source Code Audit
Maybe you have a project in progress, or an app that's already complete. We provide a third party perspective on the state of your code. Find out if your developers are using extensive testing for error-free code and if they're following RoR best practices.
