# Our Process

The transparent auditing and consultation process is a critical one in developing trust and understanding in security.

For the specific process we follow, we've selected several strategies that we feel work well for deploying secure systems, but we add and remove strategies based on the client and the team involved. We also constantly evaluate our process and make incremental changes to improve how we work.

In a nutshell, our primary focus is on communication and safety. If you want to know more specific details about how we work, please keep reading :)

## So, how does it work? The nitty-gritty details.

*   We start with an interview and walkthrough of your current systems.
    Where we'll capture all of the functionality required in the system. We
    try to extract every idea you've thought of, and some you
    may have missed, to get a comprehensive understanding of your business and how it works.

    The walkthrough process usually takes between 1-2 hours depending
    on the complexity of the system. It gives us a deeper understanding of
    how your business functions and potential risks you are exposed to.

*   Once we begin working together, you can expect to hear from us regularly.   That could be through a daily meet up or via phone, an email, or even video conference. We try to use the forms of communication that fit each client.

*   You'll see progress instantly as we work through your business and identify areas of potential abuse, error and insecurity.

    You'll be able to check the status of the audit report as we do it with clear and concise explanations and costs.


Building security is as much about people as it is expert knowledge and experience with securing data. If this sounds appealing to you, then let's talk.
